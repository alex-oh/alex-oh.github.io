                    I coordinated the design, testing, and manufacturing of testbed equipment that would maximize the amount of drilling tests that could be performed in a single environmental chamber pumpdown cycle for the upcoming test campaign for the M2020 Rover's Sample Caching Subsystem. <b>This equipment cut the number of drilling tests required to complete Phase 2 in half, saving an estimated 300+ hours of pumpdown time.</b>

                <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
                <p>
                    At JPL, I worked as an engineer supporting a test campaign for a critical Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover system (Sample Caching Subsystem) that was planned to run for the next six months after my co-op concluded. Test shifts were grueling for operators, and any time savings or conveniences were valuable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the test campaign was to simulate the operations that the Mars 2020 Rover Sample Caching Subsystem would experience while operating on Mars, to validate the integrity of the hardware in a "real-world" situation. The campaign involved many rock coring and abrading sequences, performed in Martian-like atmospheric conditions.

            <div role="problem" class="proj-sect">
                <h2><b>Problem</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Testing large quantities of rocks in this particular environmental chamber was very time consuming, since the chamber took 72 hours to reach the desired atmospheric conditions, and only five rocks could be placed in the chamber at a time.
                </p>

            <div role="objective" class="proj-sect">
                <h2><b>Objective</b></h2>
                <p>Design testbed equipment that maximizes the number of rock drilling samples that could be tested in an environmental test chamber at a time.</p>
            </div>
            <div role="design" class="proj-sect">
                <h2><b>Design</b></h2>
                <p>
                    After getting a clear idea of the problem by speaking with engineers familiar with the test chamber and the drilling sequences, I defined a set of design requirements for the equipment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3><b>Key design requirements</b></h3>
                <p>
                    - Maximizes the working area of the robotic arm<br>
                    - Fits in the test chamber inside 80/20 camera mounting structure<br>
                    - Fits on the pre-existing bolt pattern on the pedestals<br>
                    - Plates should dampen vibrations from the drilling turret<br>
                <p>
                    I also worked out the rough details for the actual design of the equipment, consulting the manufacturing department to make the design easily manufacturable. I took all of this information to a CAD designer, who modeled the plates and created the drawings for fabrication.
                </p>
                <div class="project-image"><img src="images/projects/rock/initial_concept.png" alt="" /></div>
                <p>
                    The rock bench plates consisted of four 2" thick aluminum plates ("baseplate") and four 1/2" thick aluminum plates ("skin") of the same geometry that fit on top. The baseplates were to be installed into the chamber once for the phase of the test campaign that they were to be used in. The rock bench skins would have rocks epoxied onto their surfaces. The skins would then be changed out when different rock samples were required.

                <h2><b>Structural Analysis</b></h2>
                <p>
                    I used NX Nastran to simulate some plate bending conditions that could be experienced in a regular test sequence. Additionally, I calculated the buckling stress of the pedestals that the plates would sit on top of. For both of these analyses, I worked with a structural analyst to verify the validity of the calculations.

                <h2><b>Manufacturing Readiness Review</b></h2>
                <p>
                    After a complete design was ready, I called together a manufacturing readiness review with key engineering stakeholders (mainly the I&T engineers I worked with on the daily). Some concerns were brought up about the weight of the rocks causing the 1/2" thick plates to deflect when a lift was done. We decided that a physical lift case test for the rock bench skins should be done. I redid the pedestal buckling hand calculations to include additional forces that would be experienced.
                </p>

                <h2><b>Result</b></h2>
                <p>
                    The rock bench plates doubled the number of abrasion drilling tests that could be performed in a single chamber pumpdown, which saved 300+ hours of temperature cycling waiting time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lifting test I had planned also was conducted with no major snags, which validated the structural analysis I had done before.
