            <h1><b>Ergonomic Trumpet Support</b></h1>
            <h3>Personal Project</h3>
            <br>
            <h2><b>Problem/Overview</b></h2>
            <p>
                I worked with a Boston-based trumpet player who was about to go on tour. His part in the tour required him to play keyboard with one hand and trumpet in the other simultaneously. Trumpet playing with one hand puts a great amount of unnecessary strain on the hand in question, since the placement of the finger rings is not exactly the most ergonomic. Playing a two hour show every day with this type of physical strain would be bad news.<br><br>

                    <img src="images/projects/block/hand_strain.jpg" alt="" />
                </div>
                The challenge at hand could be summed up as follows:<br><br>
                <b>Design a device that decreases the physical strain of playing trumpet one-handed.</b></p>
            </p>
            
            <h2><b>Design Process</b></h2>
            <p>
                To begin the project, I brainstormed some design concepts with the client, asking a series of questions regarding features that he wanted and certain elements of the design that were to be prioritized. From this discussion, I broke the design requirements down into two main parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Function:<br>
                - Makes single-handed trumpet playing easier.<br>
                - Easy to doff/don.<br>
                - Durable.<br>
                - Adaptable for different trumpets.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Form:<br>
                - Doesn't look too silly.<br>
                - Not too cumbersome when not in use.
            </p>
            <p>
                To manufacture prototypes, I used a laser cutter and a Form 2 SLA printer, available at Bose's rapid prototyping space while I was on co-op. I made sure to take notes for every design iteration to document improvements.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                At the time, I was very much into the idea of using magnets in an engineering project as an impermanent fastening solution. Theoretically, a magnetic connection is robust, pretty strong, and convenient for frequent application/removal purposes. I decided to prototype a magnetic glove that would fasten to a large block with inlaid magnets that was attached to the trumpet ("trumpet fixture block"). 
            </p>
            <div class="project-image">
                <img src="images/projects/block/Concept1b.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>

            <p>
                Before committing to a lengthy print job, I made a mockup of the fixture block and the mating piece out of laser-cut scrap wood to get an idea of the scale. As I prototyped these components, I ran into some problems.
            </p>

                <img src="images/projects/block/lasercut_prototypes.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>

            <p>
                <b>Problem 1:</b> Insertion of magnets into trumpet fixture block. Plan was to press-fit magnets into the block. This went well, until I wanted to remove the magnets. To remedy this issue in following prototypes (blue), I added a through hole feature that allowed me to push the magnet out from the other side of the groove.
            </p>
            <div class="project-image">
                <img src="images/projects/block/magnet_through_holes.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>

            <p>
                <b>Problem 2:</b> The glove had too much slack to provide a rigid connection to the attachment block. It was at this point that I concluded that a magnetic connection via glove attachment probably wasn't worth pursuing any further.
            </p>
            <div class="project-image">
                <img src="images/projects/block/glove_stretch.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>

            <h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
            <p>
                While I developed the glove concept and failed, I learned that the trumpet fixture block still served a purpose, since it gave the right hand something that fit better in the palm while grasping the trumpet. With this in mind, a fifth prototype was developed, removing all the magnets and the glove from the system, but retaining the same basic geometry for the fixture block. This ended up being the final prototype, which I handed off to the client as he went to go on tour.
