                    I designed a support that enabled a trumpet player to play trumpet with one hand with less strain, freeing the other hand to play keyboard simultaneously.

                    I worked with a trumpet player who wanted to play trumpet and keyboard simultaneously for his band’s new tour set. Playing trumpet with one hand usually causes physical strain in the hand, which is not sustainable for a two hour performance.

                    I brainstormed some design concepts with the client, asking a series of questions regarding features that he wanted and certain elements of the design that were to be prioritized. From this discussion, I broke the design requirements down into two main parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br><b>Function:</b><br>
                    - Makes single-handed trumpet playing easier.<br>
                    - Easy to doff/don.<br>
                    - Durable.<br>
                    - Adaptable for different trumpets.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Form:</b><br>
                    - Doesn't look too silly.<br>
                    - Not too cumbersome when not in use.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To manufacture prototypes, I used a laser cutter and a Form 2 SLA printer, available at Bose's rapid prototyping space while I was on co-op. I made sure to take notes for every design iteration to document improvements.<br><br>

                    At the time, I was very much into the idea of using magnets in an engineering project as an impermanent fastening solution. Theoretically, a magnetic connection is robust, pretty strong, and convenient for frequent application/removal purposes. I decided to prototype a magnetic glove that would fasten to a large block with inlaid magnets that was attached to the trumpet ("trumpet fixture block"). 
                </p>
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="images/projects/block/Concept1b.jpg" alt="" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Before committing to a lengthy print job, I made a mockup of the fixture block and the mating piece out of laser-cut scrap wood to get an idea of the scale. As I prototyped these components, I ran into some problems.
                </p>
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="images/projects/block/lasercut_prototypes.jpg" alt="" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    <b>Problem 1:</b> Insertion of magnets into trumpet fixture block. Plan was to press-fit magnets into the block. This went well, until I wanted to remove the magnets. To remedy this issue in following prototypes (blue), I added a through hole feature that allowed me to push the magnet out from the other side of the groove.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/projects/block/magnet_through_holes.jpg" alt="" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    <b>Problem 2:</b> The glove had too much slack to provide a rigid connection to the attachment block. It was at this point that I concluded that a magnetic connection via glove attachment probably wasn't worth pursuing any further.
                </p>
                <div class="project-image">
                    <img src="images/projects/block/glove_stretch.jpg" alt="" />

            <div role="results" class="proj-sect">
                <h2><b>Results</b></h2>
                <p>
                    While the magnetic glove concept failed, I learned that the trumpet fixture block still served a purpose, since it gave the right hand something that fit better in the palm while grasping the trumpet. With this in mind, I developed a fifth prototype, removing the magnets and the glove from the design, but retaining the same basic geometry for the fixture block. This ended up being the final prototype, which I handed off to the client as he went to go on tour.
