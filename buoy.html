                    As part of a capstone team of five, I designed a communications buoy that sent wireless signals between a computer and a UUV known as the BIOSwimmer.

                <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Boston Engineering Corporation's flagship UUV system known as the BIOSwimmer is a biomimetic tuna robot used for underwater hull and port inspection. In order to communicate with operators while submerged, the BIOSwimmer is physically tethered to a buoy that transmits a Wi-Fi signal.

                <h2><b>Problem</b></h2>
                <p>
                    The existing communication buoy used to relay data and commands between the BIOSwimmer and the operating computer was unreliable. Communications would frequently drop out during operations, due to the shape and size of the buoy.

                <h2><b>Objective</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Design a communications buoy that maintains a reliable wireless connection during operation. A “reliable” design would maintain a strong signal for at least 80% of the duration of our testing.

                <p>
                    We started by speaking with the design engineers who worked on the BIOSwimmer, to get a better idea of the problem. We also conducted a root cause study to identify the primary cause of signal dropout, which consisted of submerging a box containing the Wi-Fi module in various orientations in water.

                    After brainstorming many design concepts, the team selected two designs that would be developed for prototyping phase I.

                <h2><b>Prototyping</b></h2>
                <p>
                    I was responsible for designing and modeling the third concept, which was a buoy that incorporated a gimbal system to suspend the Wi-Fi module above the surface of the water. Suspending the Wi-Fi module above the water would reduce optical interference from tall waves during operation.

                <h2><b>Testing</b></h2>
                <p>
                    I was also responsible for creating the test plans that would be used to evaluate the performance of our prototypes. By pinging the buoy’s Wi-Fi module, we generated plots that tracked the buoy’s signal performance while it was towed in two different movement sequences.

                <h2><b>Refinement</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the results from our Proto I testing, we selected the gimbal buoy for further refinement and testing. Parts were updated to make the design easier to assemble and more structurally sound.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Following our second round of testing, we determined that our gimbal buoy design successfully transmitted signals for 95% of testing time. Compared to the already existing buoy, our design was a significant improvement that would benefit BIOSwimmer operations.
