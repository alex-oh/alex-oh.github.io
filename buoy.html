            <h1><b>Towed Communications Buoy</b></h1>
            <h3>Senior Capstone</h3>
            <br>
            <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
            <p>
                Boston Engineering Corporation's flagship UUV system known as the BIOSwimmer is a tuna-inspired robot used for underwater hull and port inspection. In order to communicate with operators while submerged, the BIOSwimmer is physically tethered to a buoy that transmits Wi-Fi signal.

            </div>
            <h2><b>Problem</b></h2>
            <p>
                The original communication buoy used to relay data and commands between the BIOSwimmer and the operating computer was unreliable. Communications would frequently drop out, due to the shape and size of the buoy.

            <h2><b>Process</b></h2>
            <p>
                We brainstormed many concepts in the summer term, eventually narrowing down to two designs that we prototyped and tested. After the first round of prototyping, we selected our gimbal buoy design to be further refined. Testing and fluid simulation with OpenFOAM, an open source CFD simulation package, were performed to validate the performance of our designs. With the conclusion of Testing Phase 2, we presented our refined prototype design at the end-of-semester capstone presentation day, winning an award for “Most Technically Sound” in our track.

            <p>
                For this project, I modeled the initial design for the gimbal prototype using Solidworks, and worked with another teammate to generate the test plans that would be used throughout the design process. I also assembled some of the prototypes/components, and performed some of the surface finishing/rework for 3D printed parts that required it.
